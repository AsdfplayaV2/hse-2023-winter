- Implement a distributed environment with technologies of your choice
- It should consist of at least 2 application components and 1 backend
- The backend can be any type of database or messaging system (Postgres, Mongo, Redis, Kafka ...)
- The application logic is not so important
- One project can be done by 2 people max
- The application components need to be in a Docker container format -> Dockerfile for each component is required
- A docker-compose for the overall app is also required
- Some kind of documentation would be nice (ChatGPT can be your friend here)

- Focus on observability
- Use implementation language which is supported by OTel: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/
